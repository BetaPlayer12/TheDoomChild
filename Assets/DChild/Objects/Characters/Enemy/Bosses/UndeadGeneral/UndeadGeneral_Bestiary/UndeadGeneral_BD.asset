  m_description: 'Booze and ale, a soul drunk on pride - taking delight in crushing
    anyone who dared defy him. Peasants, sewage filth, mere rats in the gutter: this
    was his calling. Crushing the weak under his feet, bathing in their blood - as
    the mountains of bodies grew, so did his ego.'
  m_storeNotes: It seems humans don't really need their organs to survive. Since
    his egotism kept him alive...literally.
