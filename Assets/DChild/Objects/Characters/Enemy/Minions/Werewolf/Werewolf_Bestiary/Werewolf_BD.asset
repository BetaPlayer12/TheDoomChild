  m_description: Victims of an excavation gone awry. Human miners that succumbed
    to the forest's curse, they left most of their humanity behind as their bestial
    instincts took over. They now hide within the caves they once exploited, in fear
    of the Protegor that guard the forest floor.
  m_storeNotes: This is the pinnacle of human evolution? Never in my existence did
    I feel as lucky to be a folio as I do now.
