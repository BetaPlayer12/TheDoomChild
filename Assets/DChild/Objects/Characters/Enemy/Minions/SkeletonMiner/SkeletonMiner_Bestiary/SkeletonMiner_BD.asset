  m_description: Hope is as rare as it can be in the city.  However, small sparks
    from the despondencies of souls manifest within these beings. These bones swore
    to dig their way through whatever's in their path. Each hack is made with no
    direction of where life truly is.
  m_storeNotes: A shame that their grind is being used to dig up crystals for big-wigs.
    What else can I say? Ah, capitalism.
