  m_description: These souls were once exemplary academics chosen to descend in the
    madness of Constellations. Upon discovery of the Truth, they rejected it and
    sought ignorance. Such attachment to the self is in need of purging. The humanity
    they held onto is now lost in aimless roaming.
  m_storeNotes: The only thing these ectoplasms are good for is scaring visitors
    away with all its brooding.
