  m_description: These flighty creatures originated from surrounding crows in the
    area. Venturing into the depths of the city led to their end. However, it also
    granted them a new beginning. Their newfound eyes and wings give more freedom.
    Lasers aim to eradicate what ruins their scenery.
  m_storeNotes: Look at it following you around like a lost pup. Heed well, it'll
    send a laser if you don't play with them.
