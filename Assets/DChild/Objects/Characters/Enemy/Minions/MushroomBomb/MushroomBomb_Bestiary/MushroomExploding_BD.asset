  m_description: These fungi arise from soil with twice the poison in its roots.
    They chase after its prey like a rabid beast - eager to tear off what disturbed
    its peace. Yet, the spores condensed in their anatomy are a fragile thing. A
    single trigger sets them off with an explosive pop.
  m_storeNotes: Wouldn't want to be the brute that got reincarnated into a monstrous
    shroom.
