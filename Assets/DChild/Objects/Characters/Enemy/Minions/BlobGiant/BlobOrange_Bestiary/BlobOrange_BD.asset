  m_description: The NRG-V is a step further than the initial creation. Shocked with
    waves of energy, it is electric both in appearance and strength. Each voltage
    increases its appetite in wanting more. Its tentacles reach out boldly with an
    eagerness to grasp what is ahead.
  m_storeNotes: Looks like somebody left their orange-flavored jelly around for far
    too long - it practically mutated.
