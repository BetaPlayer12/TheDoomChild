  m_description: Apathy is enough violence by itself. Before their transmutation,
    each prison guard faced only ahead. Thus, fell ignorant and callous to the cries
    of those they guard. These infernos pledged allegiance to Mother in exchange
    for a burgeoning. Both in distance and feeling.
  m_storeNotes: You're telling me that they bowed down to a living monster prison
    so they can avoid more creatures? Respect.
