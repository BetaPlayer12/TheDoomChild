  m_description: 'An ambitious venture, an impossible feat, but as everything neared
    perfection, it was abandoned. Alone, it sat - waiting. Always waiting. As electricity
    fueled its artificial vessel, flowing through its veins, it came alive. A human,
    a monster, a mistake, was born. '
  m_storeNotes: He is definitely the middle child in his family. That's for sure.
