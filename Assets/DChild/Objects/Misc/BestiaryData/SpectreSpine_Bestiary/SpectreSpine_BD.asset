  m_description: "Somber spirits, pitiful remains of what things used to be. Vanity
    and insignificance. Happiness and sadness. Every fiber of their being, reduced
    to nothing but empty. They seek out lost travelers, impaling them - desperate
    to have what they have, to ultimately be something. \r"
