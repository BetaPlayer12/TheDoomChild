  m_description: "Beauty follows Mother Mantis' every step. Slithering thorns from
    the pod she stems from encloses every fringe of the area. Slowly, it sucks away
    the essence of what it pricks in order to replenish only herself and where she
    roams. Behold, the Flower of the Garden - Kor'nth.\r"
  m_storeNotes: Appearance truly isn't everything. She should've been born a leech,
    if you would ask me.
