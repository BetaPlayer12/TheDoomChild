  m_description: "Once a symbol of purity, now tainted with a lust for blood. The
    Lich King's ascent brought with him the spirit of Boshiet. It now operates its
    will through the statues it inhabits. The sense of sight is abandoned, all to
    obtain more hands for butchering with its own sword.\r"
  m_storeNotes: I'd rather have four eyes than extra limbs. That way, I can see through
    everyone's crap way easier.
