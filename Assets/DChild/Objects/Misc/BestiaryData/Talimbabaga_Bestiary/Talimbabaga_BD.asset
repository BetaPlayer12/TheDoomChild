  m_description: 'Skittering, crawling, relishing in the sound of cracking as they
    dig their claws into oh so sweet flesh - growing into an amalgamation of meat
    and bones. Born from the inadequacies of mankind, they roam the temple halls
    in search of what they desire most - everything. '

    even insects can be trendsetters huh...
