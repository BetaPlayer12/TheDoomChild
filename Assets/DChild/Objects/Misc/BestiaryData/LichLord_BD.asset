  m_description: Cultivator, necromancer, overseer, lord. Lost souls require guidance.
    From the goodness of his heart, he has taken up this role. However, sacrifices
    must be made. One must lose a part of oneself in order to be whole. Only then
    will the Gelferd's flowers bloom once more.
  m_storeNotes: Aren't you feeling a little dejected? Insulted, even? A literal flying
    torso is draining you of your money!
