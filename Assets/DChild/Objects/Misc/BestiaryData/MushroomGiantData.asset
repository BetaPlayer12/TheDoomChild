  m_description: A matured mutation of Bulb'om. These fungi have mastered the art
    of controlling innate spores. At will, its body allows itself to fold into forms
    that fit its objective. Its demise lies in the constant movement of spores -
    aggravating its explosive power with each hit made.
  m_storeNotes: "These fungi could practically render balloons useless, can\u2019t
    they?"
