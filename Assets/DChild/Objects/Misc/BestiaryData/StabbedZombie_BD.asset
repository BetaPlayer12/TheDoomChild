  m_description: Obstinate gladiators that refuse to accept their defeat. At their
    release, these bleeding warriors roam the area before finding themselves back
    at the coliseum. They thus gain the opposite of an honorable death - cut down
    for the purpose of serving as practice targets.
  m_storeNotes: Disintegrating sounds a lot better than parading my dead body after
    a defeat. Double the humiliation.
