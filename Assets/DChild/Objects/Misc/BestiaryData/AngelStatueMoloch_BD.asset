  m_description: "Once a symbol of faith, now blinded into that of despair. The statue
    of Opfren twists into place. Its snake-like limbs aim with accuracy to shoot
    living souls to their death. The spirit of Moloch, ancient entity ascended with
    the Lich King, has found its home here.\r"
  m_storeNotes: Could it move any slower? This isn't a competition for who has the
    best posture.
