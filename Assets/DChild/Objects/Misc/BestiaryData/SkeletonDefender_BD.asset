  m_description: Proud henchmen of the Royal Death Guard, they guard the castle with
    unwavering loyalty. Armed with mighty shields, they defend the halls, denying
    entrance to those who do not belong. Their bodies strung together by magic, leaving
    them with but only one purpose, to protect.
  m_storeNotes: They have shields but not a full set of armor. Well, I guess we know
    where Death's entire budget went to.
