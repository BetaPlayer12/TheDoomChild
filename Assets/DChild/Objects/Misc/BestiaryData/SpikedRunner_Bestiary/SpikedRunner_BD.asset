  m_description: From within the foliage, the rotten arise. Once towering trees,
    now reduced to a pile of decomposing waste. As the corruption flows through their
    mutated bodies, they chase down intruders, impaling them with their sharp thorns.
  m_storeNotes: Why are you running away from it?! It's basically a pile of rotten
    sticks!
