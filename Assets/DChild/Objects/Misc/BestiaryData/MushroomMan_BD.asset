  m_description: The metamorphosis state of Ven'lly. Emerging with more limbs from
    its previous cocoon, these fungi roam on land. Its tentacles swing forward with
    the intent to clear its path. Illuminating within the poison fumes, they seek
    a way out of the mist they're in.
  m_storeNotes: Is it a mushroom? Is it a jellyfish? No! It's a stingy noodle.
