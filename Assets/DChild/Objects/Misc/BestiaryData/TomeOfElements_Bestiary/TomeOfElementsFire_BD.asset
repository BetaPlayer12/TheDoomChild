  m_description: With each flip of a page, the stars align, granting mere humans
    the chance to speak to the gods themselves. As the first flames forge the heavens,
    as the world is set ablaze, fire is both creation and destruction - and Krios
    shall rule them all.
  m_storeNotes: Don't even dare compare me with those lowlives. I am a folio, and
    they are books. Huge difference.
