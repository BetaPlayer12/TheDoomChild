  m_description: "Corruption at its purest, they move as though it were a living
    being. Made of poison so potent that it\u2019s capable of killing a hundred humans
    with one drop. However, they don't remain in this form for long as they slowly
    seep into the soil, infecting everything around it. "
  m_storeNotes: Funny how the source of all corruption is a hopping scoop of ice
    cream.
