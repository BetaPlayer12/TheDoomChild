  m_description: At the testing of human anatomy for such homunculi, it was born.
    The creation was brought to life by electrical energy and a unique genetic code.
    With the ability to harness electricity from within, every shock is a testament
    to its innate desire - to become what it is not.
  m_storeNotes: Don't let that portable charging station shock you to an existential
    crisis about your origin. You get me?
