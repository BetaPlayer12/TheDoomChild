  m_description: Birthed from imagination, brought to life by science. Energy overflowed
    from their artificial bodies, granting these homunculi the power to defy the
    rules of the world itself. In exchange for their pseudo-humanity, they are able
    to manipulate matter and energy as we know it
  m_storeNotes: Don't move! Can't you see that the light's still red? We need to
    follow what the walking traffic light says!
