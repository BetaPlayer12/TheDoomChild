  m_description: From within the earth, the dead emerge. Bodies of fallen adventurers,
    succumbing to the corruption - human vessels serving as a vehicle controlled
    by the fungi. Their flesh, nourishment for the rotten, roaming about the gardenscape
    as beings of neither dead nor living.
  m_storeNotes: The amount of trust issues you may have to literally grow a farm
    on your own back so you can care for them.
