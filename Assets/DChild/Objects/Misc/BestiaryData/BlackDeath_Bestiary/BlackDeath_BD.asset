  m_description: The Black Death is the Realm of the Dead's sole overlord. The many
    boasts of the throne - soul-embedded walls, razor-sharp blades, and his infamous
    undead army - all attest to his greatness. However, not a soul knows how time
    was before this ruler inhabited the castle.
  m_storeNotes: Now, here's a villain when I see one! Mind tapping out for a chance
    to sit on your beloved throne, BD?
