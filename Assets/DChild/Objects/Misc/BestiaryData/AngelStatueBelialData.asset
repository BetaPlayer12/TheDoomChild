  m_description: "Once a symbol of kindness, now corrupted with notions of pride
    and hostility. The spear of justice now rests in the hands of an unjust spirit.
    Felein ascended with the Lich King into the statues it \rfinds solace in. With
    a screech, it looks to pierce through uncorrupt souls.\r"
  m_storeNotes: Dragging its feet like a months-old baby - I don't know how it expects
    you to take it seriously.
