  m_description: ' At the brink of her last moments, the forest gave her a new purpose
    to live. There is none that may separate the forest and its inhabitants from
    herself. The Queen Bee shall use any object and soul at her disposal - even her
    own. Thus, the bestowal of her namesake: Cieranna.'
  m_storeNotes: I heard the Queen was rewarded for killing someone. Hah! What's your
    reward going to be?
