  m_description: A roaming bird whose wings had been cut after a single exhale. The
    gas exuded by poison shrooms infested in the lungs of these avians. Sticking
    to each area, the spores found a place to bloom cruelly while corrupting inside.
    It soon reveals its evolution with a piercing cry.
  m_storeNotes: I've seen flightless birds but never one that acts like a prickly
    bunny.
