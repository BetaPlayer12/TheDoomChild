  m_description: Be it darkness, light. May it be under the scorching sun, or trapped
    in unrelenting winter, The One sees it all. Agents of the incomprehensible, they
    guard the temple, patiently waiting in the shadows. For their prey could never
    seem to resist the call of their bloodweb.

    if its body can still keep moving.
