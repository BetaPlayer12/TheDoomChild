  m_description: The epitome of loyalty. Since the beginning of time, the Black Death's
    right-hand aide existed to serve him. His scythe has cut down many that dares
    to defy the Realm's rightful ruler. Under this Death Guard, the undead army answers
    - to steal, kill, and destroy.
  m_storeNotes: The scythe is sharp - but the senses? Eh, not much. Swinging that
    ancient thing around doesn't equal skill.
