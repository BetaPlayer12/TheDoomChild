  m_description: Fallen adventurers that met their demise at the Favor for The Undying.
    Deep-seated lust for the thrill of their last moments is inside each. This led
    them to sneak into the training barracks of undead gladiators. Alas, seeking
    the bloodiest weapon and shield to take their place.
  m_storeNotes: A cowardly brat playing with toys. Hey, be a dear and strike it down
    mid-tantrum so I can laugh at its face.
