141373,284,11,7,,,Imp,"This is a mischievous little demon that is making fun with its victim by making objects disappear and reappear but this behavior only works on the realm of nightmare. It can also set up barrel bomb as a trap then explodes when the proximity sensor is triggered.

IMP 
---

##### STATS RATING: (1-10)

Health     : 2
Damage     : 5 (this is for barrel bomb damage only)
Difficulty : 6 (due to its invisibility behavior)

---
### **BEHAVIOR:**


##### PATROL:
1.	When player is not detected move between two designated points.

##### DETECT PLAYER:
1.	Play detection animation to cue that it saw the player.
2.	Its player-sensor would be 4.5CH or 4.5 Character Height. (_4.5CH in front and 4.5CH in its back_)
a.	Overall sensor dimension is 9CH (Width) x 4CH (Height) and the imp will be placed at the center.
3.	Play detection animation if attacked even if the player is outside its detection range then play despawn.

##### ATTACK: (Other location)
1.	After the detection animation, play regurgitate-bomb animation.
2.	Play the despawn animation if the barrel bomb was already set in place.
3.	If the player attacks the barrel bomb during the regurgitation animation, trigger explosion effects (sound and visuals) and play knock-back animation then despawn.
4.	If the bomb explosion successfully hits the player, trigger the Imps laughing sound #1.
5.	~~(Can regurgitate bomb even if it in its invisible state?????)~~

##### DESPAWN TO INVISIBLE MODE:
1.	After the bomb placement, play despawn animation and trigger the Imps laughing sound #1. 
2.	Turn-off the IMPs hurtbox when it is in its invisible state.

##### RESPAWN TO VISIBLE MODE:
1.	When player is not detected for 3 to 5min, play respawn animation and trigger the laughing sound #2.
2.	It will remain invisible if it still detects the player.

##### DEATH:
1.	Play death animation if killed and trigger the laughing sound #3.
Respawn from Death:
1.	1 min after its death, play respawn animation and trigger the laughing sound #2. (use the same animation as the respawn to visible mode)

##### SOUND CUE:
1.	The laughing sound of despawn and successful bomb damage to player will trigger the laughing sound #1. (a cute but super evil laugh).
2.	The laughing sound of respawn to visible mode and respawn from death will trigger the laughing sound #2 (a cute but super evil laugh or we can also use a woohoow or yahoo sound).
3.	The laughing sound of the Imps death will trigger the laughing sound #3 (a suffering but still has a cute and super evil laugh).

---

#### **IMP'S SPECIAL BEHAVIOR:** (Realm of Nightmare only)
1.	The disappearance and reappearance of pre-determined platforms and walls are part of the Realm of Nightmares game mechanics that reacts to the players jump animation and we will just use the Imp minions as if they are the one causing this trickery.
2.	The disappearance and reappearance of platforms and walls will randomly trigger the Imps laughing sound as if it is still around making fun with the player.
3.	According to Sir Hai, we will only show the Imps despawn animation once something like an in-game cinematics then we will not show its physical form to the player ever again. We will just randomly trigger the Imps laughing sound when the platform and walls disappears and reappears.
4.	We will not use Bomber Imp animation in the realm of the nightmare.",3/16/2021 6:46:57 AM,3/31/2023 7:41:46 AM

**[OLD]**
It is a spherical crystal blessed with magical abilities and enhancements. The crystals can be acquired after defeating or slaying an enemy Boss and it can only be activated using the ancient stone relic.

All Soul Skills can only be assigned to one specific Soul Slot. Once an empty slot had been chosen, the inventory box will appear and displays the soul skills (acquired) to be assigned.

Types of Souls Skills:
- Blessed Crystals - are soul crystal orbs inside the body of an enemy boss. These orbs can be acquired after defeating an enemy then unlocks its active skills/abilities for the next user.
- Cursed Crystals - are soul crystal orbs with trapped enemy boss inside it. These orbs can be acquired easily from the merchant, hidden rooms and puzzle rewards but the skills/abilities are inactive and can be activated after defeating the enemy inside it.
